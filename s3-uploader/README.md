# React JS Project Setup from GitHub

This README file will guide you through the process of setting up a React JS project downloaded from GitHub. Additionally, we will create a `.env` file and define the required environment variables for your project.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository:** First, you need to clone the GitHub repository containing your React JS project. Open your terminal and run the following command, replacing `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository:

    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

   This will download the project to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

3. **Install Project Dependencies:** To install the required project dependencies, run:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

   This command will read the `package.json` file and download all the necessary packages.

4. **Create a `.env` File:** You need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project to store the environment variables. Use a text editor or the terminal to create the file:

    ```
    touch .env
    ```

5. **Define Environment Variables:** Open the `.env` file in a text editor, and add the following lines with your specific values:

    ```dotenv
    REACT_APP_AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<your_aws_access_key>
    REACT_APP_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_aws_secret_access_key>
    REACT_APP_AWS_REGION=<your_aws_region>
    REACT_APP_AWS_BUCKET_NAME=<your_aws_bucket_name>
    ```

   Replace `<your_aws_access_key>`, `<your_aws_secret_access_key>`, `<your_aws_region>`, and `<your_aws_bucket_name>` with your actual AWS credentials and configuration.

6. **Start the React Application:** Now that you have set up your environment variables, you can start the React application using the following command:

    ```
    npm start
    ```
