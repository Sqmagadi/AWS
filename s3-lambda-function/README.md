 Design and implement a solution that can help an organization improve its document management system. The goal is to enable writers to upload documents directly to an S3 bucket, which will make it easier for the team leader to keep track of all documents and their word count. Your team should create a simple solution to allow writers to upload documents in an S3 bucket, and send a notification to the team leader with the word count every time a document is uploaded to the bucket.
